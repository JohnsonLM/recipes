- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups self-rising flour
- 1 ¾ cups milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
- butter or nonstick cooking spray

Combine ingredients in a bowl and mix with a fork until bubbly with only small lumps. Lightly grease waffle iron (too much will cuase greasy waffles) and poor mixture into iron. Cook until golden brown.
