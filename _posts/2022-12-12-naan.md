- 1/2 cup warm water
- 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour

Combine sugar, warm water, and yeast and wait for yeast to activate and become foamy (10 min). Add yeast mixture, yoghurt, salt, and oil to flour and knead until smooth and shiny. Cover dough with a cloth in a warm place and let rise for 1 hour.

Divide the dough into 8 portions and roll the dough into disks. Cook disks one at a time on high in a greased cast-iron skillet until puffy. Flip and repeat until browned on both sides. oil/spice as desired.
