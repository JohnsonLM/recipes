- 4 1/2 cups (550g) Bread Flour
- 1 tablespoon (11g) Sugar
- 2 1/4 teaspoons Yeast
- 2 1/2 teaspoons (12g) Salt
- 1 2/3 cups (380g) Water
- Cornmeal (pan coating)

Combine dry ingredients then add lukewarm water until shaggy. Knead dough on a floured surface until rubbery and smooth. Move to an oiled bowl and cover in a warm (70°+) place for 1-2 hours until size is doubled.

Divide the dough into 2 portions and shape the dough into your desired shape. Place on a pan coated in cornmeal and let rise covered for 1 hour until puffy. 

Bake bread at 450° for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown. Let cook before slicing.
